bjsim
=====

A blackjack simulator in Ruby and a partial port of this code to Groovy.

Conclusion: don't play blackjack unless you can count cards without being
detected by the casino.

The **ruby/** directory contains the ruby implementation **bjsim.rb** and several scripts to run
many tests of this code, which is how I came to the conclusion stated above.

The **groovy/** directory contains the beginning of a groovy port of the ruby code.

Have fun!
